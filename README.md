# LittleBee Firmware
This is a under development project, littleBee is a BeeHives monitoring node using sensor nodes, it
estimate bee behavior by analyzing its emitted sound, using simple feature extraction based
on FFT on audio frame. This is the firmware of sensor node and was aimed to be built on STM evaluation 
platform SensorTile using its embedded mic.

# memory footprint:
Under development, coming soon
  
# Main Features:

- Real time audio capture;
- Simple feature extraction algorithm;
- Low power;
- Simple, event driven and bare metal firmware;
- Bluetooth low energy communication;


# Basic Usage:

- This firmware was firstly developed in Atollic True Studio v8.0;
- Obtain the IDE and clone this repo;
- Open the Atollic, and import this project on workspace;
- untick the option to copy project on workspace;
- Just build and flash to sensor tile.
